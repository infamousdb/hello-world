# hello-world This is me doing what a million others have done when trying to learn a new thing. My name is david Bailey .....no not the famous photographer :) I decided to embark on this programming journey as i am so intrigued by the way programs currently help run my whole life from the apps on my phone to technology i use at work all of which is moving forward at a rapid rate. I want to be a part of this but not merely just a passenger...I want to create, innovate, and help others as well as push my own understanding of where this will take us in the years to come. 
Day one. Lets see how far i go!!!
Thanks for reading.
